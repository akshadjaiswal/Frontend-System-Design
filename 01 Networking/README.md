# üåê Module 1: Networking

## üìñ Overview
This module introduces the core concepts of **networking in frontend system design**.  
Understanding how the web works, communication protocols, and different API approaches is essential for building scalable and reliable frontend systems.

The learnings are based on **Namaste Frontend System Design (Akshay & Chirag)**, with additional insights for practical understanding.

---

## üìå Important Guidelines
- Grasp the **foundations of web communication** before diving into higher-level abstractions.  
- Always think in terms of **scalability, security, and performance** while designing communication flows.  
- Learn the **trade-offs** of different API design approaches (REST, GraphQL, gRPC).  
- Keep in mind **real-world implementations** where different protocols and APIs come into play.  

---

## üéØ Topics Covered

### 1. Networking ‚Äì Akshay & Chirag‚Äôs Experience
Akshay and Chirag share their perspective on why **networking is the backbone of frontend system design**.  
They emphasize understanding low-level fundamentals before applying modern tools and frameworks.

---

### 2. How the Web Works
- Covers the **fundamental mechanics** powering the internet.  
- How browsers, servers, and networks interact to deliver content.  
- Understanding **DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, IP addresses, and requests/responses** as the foundation of web applications.  

---

### 3. Communication Protocols
- Exploration of **protocols** that enable data exchange over the internet.  
- Covers **HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, WebSockets, and SSE (Server-Sent Events)**.  
- Helps in choosing the right protocol for **performance, reliability, and scalability** in frontend systems.  

---

### 4. REST APIs
- Introduction to **Representational State Transfer (REST)**.  
- Understanding REST‚Äôs **constraints, principles, and best practices**.  
- Why REST is widely adopted and how it helps in designing **robust and scalable web services**.  

---

### 5. GraphQL
- Overview of **GraphQL** as an alternative to REST.  
- Focus on **efficient data querying, reduced over-fetching/under-fetching**, and flexibility for frontend developers.  
- Real-world use cases where GraphQL enhances **frontend performance and developer productivity**.  

---

### 6. gRPC
- Introduction to **gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)**.  
- A **high-performance communication framework** often used in microservices and distributed systems.  
- Key benefits: **speed, efficiency, strongly-typed contracts**.  
- Why frontend developers should understand gRPC when working in **modern system architectures**.  

---

## üèÅ Learning Outcomes
By completing this module, you will:
- Understand **how the web works at its core**.  
- Compare different **communication protocols** and know when to use them.  
- Gain clarity on **REST, GraphQL, and gRPC** trade-offs.  
- Build a solid networking foundation for **scalable frontend system design**.
